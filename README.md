# BrawlerClassWrath
Brawling goes from the Stolen Lands to the Worldwound

Ports over the Brawler class as it was implemented in Call of the Wild for Kingmaker. Archetypes currently not included.

**How to install**

1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager), make sure it is at least version 0.23.0
2. Run Unity Mod Manager and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous
3. Download this mod
4. Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 5 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab

**Thanks**

Vek17 and their Tabletop Tweaks mod, couldn't understand how to actually do some of this stuff I couldn't dissect and take apart how your mod worked. 

Holic92/Holic75 and their Call of the Wild mod, since it's way easier to port a class when the original mod maker uses a permissive license for me to just wholesale copy it and then get to work on making it work under the changed systems of WoTR.

Would not even get close to knowing how to make it on my own so the help is appreciated. :v
